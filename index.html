            If you're considering purchasing your own tailwheel airplane, flying with us is a great way to 
            build and hone your skills before you take the plunge.
            Insurance companies like to see plenty of tailwheel hours. Why keep flying a 172 or Cherokee
            if that's not the direction you want to go?

            <p class="bio">
              Kevin is the owner of Total Tailwheel. He learned to fly in 2017 and soon after he bought
              N3472C. Perhaps like you, he was looking for something different. N3472 offered him the opportunity
              to do a wide variety of flying, from short hops to the beach to cross-country trips to the mountains,
              VFR and IFR flying. Now, he's formed Total Tailwheel to offer you the opportunity to have
              the same opportunity. He's found N3472 to be a great teacher. She's fun, reliably, capable, and 
              versatile. He hopes you'll enjoy flying her as much as he does.

            <h3>Matt Crane, Instructor</h3>
            <p class="bio">
              Matt has been flying since 1984, when he took his first GA flight in a Royal Air Force DeHavilland Chipmunk.
              Fascinated with the smell of Avgas, oil and leather, and hypnotized by the old taildragger's sinuous taxiing,
              Matt was finally hooked on aviation when, 20 minutes later, he was introduced to aerobatics. Almost 10,000
              hours of flight time later, he's an ATP rated instructor and check airman in the King Air, having flown most
              things from model airplanes, to paragliders, high performance gliders, aerobatic airplanes, through twin engine
              jet airliners. With over 5,000 hours of dual instruction given, he enjoys sharing his love for aviation in a wide
              gamut of piston and turboprop airplanes. Whenever possible, he prefers to return to basic stick and rudder
              flying in taildraggers, in which he has over 1,900 hours of fun-filled memories.
